# First_100s
Aquatic invertebrate sampling simulations, guided by my research with Dr. C. Riley Nelson.

Simulates different amounts of specimens to collect via our First 100s thought process. Compares 
richness and abundance between different sample sizes and the baseline values of the entire dataset.
